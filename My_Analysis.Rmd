*1. Simulating data and plotting it*  

As a demonstration, we are going to create a PDF document that samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation a quarter. Below is a histogram of the sample:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
x<-rlnorm(n=100,1,0.25)
hist(x)
```

And below is a histogram of the log of the sample, recovering the familiar normal distribution:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}

xx<-log(x)
hist(xx)

```

The mean and variance are respectively:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mean(x)

var(x)
```
